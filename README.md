# Problem B: Feed Mixing and Processing Issue

## Background
The feed processing plant needs to process a batch of animal energy feed. The processing involves multiple raw materials, which are sourced from different production areas and exhibit variations in efficiency. The processing task requires mixing 16 types of raw materials and placing them into 9 processing bins for treatment. The quality of the processed feed is determined by the degree of kinship after mixing, and the energy consumption rate is also an important consideration.

## Objectives

1. **Kinship Value Statistical Analysis**: Study the kinship values between pairs of the 16 raw materials and perform statistical analysis.
2. **Mixing Scheme for Highest Feed Quality**: Establish a mathematical model to determine the mixing scheme with the highest kinship degree.
3. **Mixing Scheme with Energy Consumption Rate Over 80%**: Establish a mathematical model to find the mixing scheme that maximizes the number of processing packages with an average energy consumption rate exceeding 80%.
4. **Low-Cost Processing Scheme**: Allow some processing bins not to produce, and establish a model to complete the processing task at the lowest possible cost while maximizing the number of processing packages with an energy consumption rate exceeding 80%.
5. **Comprehensive Optimization Scheme**: In a scenario where some processing bins are allowed not to produce, establish a model to maximize feed quality, minimize processing costs, and maximize the number of processing packages with an energy consumption rate exceeding 80%.
